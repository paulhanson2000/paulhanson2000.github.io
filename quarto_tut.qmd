# Intro to Quarto
Every file begins with a YAML header (YAML is "Yet Another Markup Language"), and is followed by R, Python, Bash, or OJS code blocks.\
Between code blocks, you can write in Markdown text, like this text right now! ([Markdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html))\
[The "format:" argument specifies how to render your code document. It can be HTML (required for interactive stuff), PDF, or a [variety of other formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html)]{.aside}
